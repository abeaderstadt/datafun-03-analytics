This repository contains Python scripts designed to perform data analysis and processing tasks on various datasets. The project focuses on working with CSV, Excel, Text, and JSON files. 


Steps for Project Initialization

1. Create a New Repository From Scratch


2. Use Git to clone the new repository to your local machine using Command:

    git clone https://github.com/youraccount/yourrepo

Hint- Add your GitHub Repo URL

3. Add files such as .gitignore and requirements.txt


4. Use Git to add, commit, and push your new files to GitHub using Commands:

git add .
git commit -m "Add .gitignore and requirements.txt files"
git push -u origin main

Hint- Replace the commit message with a clear and descriptive note about what you added or changed. Wrap the commit message in double quotes.

Hint- after subsequent changes, you may be able to use Command:
    git push

5. Create a Local Python Virtual Environment for your project using Command:
    py -m venv .venv


Continue With the Repeatable Project Workflow


1. Pull the Latest Changes from GitHub using Command:
    git pull origin main


2. Active the Project Virtual Environment using Command: 
    .venv\Scripts\activate


3. Install Dependencies As Needed using Commands:
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    py -m pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run Scripts - create a small test script 

5. Modify code and test functionality

6. Save your work with git add-commit-push to GitHub using Commands:

git add .
git commit -m "Add .gitignore and requirements.txt files"
git push -u origin main
